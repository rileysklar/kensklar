## Impressionist Photographer

Welcome to my website. I hope you enjoy my visual journey through the natural world with a welcoming heart.

Influenced by Impressionist painters such as Monet, as a photographer I use light to combine interpretations of reality with elements of imagination.

Drawing strength from my connection with nature, I create visual images which honor its beauty and magic.

Each season brings new sights and feelings which I try to capture in my images. When in nature I listen with my heart and find the flowers of what we have been and the seeds of what we are becoming.
